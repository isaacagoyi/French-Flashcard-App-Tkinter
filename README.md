# French-Flashcard-App-Tkinter
A simple Python flashcard app to help you learn French vocabulary using a graphical interface built with **Tkinter** and **Pandas**.
The app:
- Shows a **French word** first  
- Flips after 3 seconds to reveal the **English translation**  
- Lets you mark words as **learned**, so they won’t show up again next time you run the app 🎉
